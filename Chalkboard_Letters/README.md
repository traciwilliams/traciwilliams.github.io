Spell your Name on the Chalkboard

## Getting Started

The alphabet is on the left hand side and the user should drag letters to the chalkboard to spell their name. These are various drag and drop functions that happen once the user selects a letter to drag over to the chalkboard.

## Installing

N/A

## Technologies

HTML CSS JavaScript

## Versioning

0.0.1 - Work in progress - I would like to add a blank line so more of a message could be made instead of just a name.
