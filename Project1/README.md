a baseball trivia game 
a correct answer equals a run and an incorrect answer equals an out

tibit about your approach
I seemed to have written alot of code but didn't know how to put everything all together. So I had a function, a constructor and a timer but they were all in separate 

future projects
I would like to make the CSS work better when transitioning from question to question
